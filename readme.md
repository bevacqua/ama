# Ask me anything

> :book: A repository to ask [@bevacqua](https://github.com/bevacqua) anything.

I've been doing open-source stuff [since 2012](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/first), as well as [writing](https://ponyfoo.com/books) and [speaking](https://ponyfoo.com/speaking) at conferences. If you have a question about my work or if you're looking for emoji this is the place you're looking for.

# Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
- Be civil and polite.

# Twitter

If you have a precise question, just ask on Twitter [(@nzgb)](https://twitter.com/nzgb) _-- I have open DMs, too_.

# Email

If you have questions you really don't want others to see for some reason, use [ama@ponyfoo.com](mailto:ama@ponyfoo.com)
